JavaScript Developer

[Tobias Reiss](../media/img/team/reiss.jpg)

I'm a Web Developer since 2001 when I joined a startup where my job was to 
build web apps for customers in the financial sector. From tiny web tools to 
complex projects, from little customers to big players in the financial market.
JavaScript became my swiss army knife for client-side pixel manipulation 
and vector rendering.

In 2011 it was time to move to a company that concentrates on the language 
i prefer, JavaScript.
