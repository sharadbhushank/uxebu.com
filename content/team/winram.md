As self confessed geek for well over 30 years, Phil is continually exploring technology for real world context and application. He began with Honeywell Industrial Automation and Control (IAC) and this brought him from Canada to the Middle East and then to Europe over an eight year career.
In 2000, he took on a senior management role with CMG Wireless Data Solutions (now Acision), a telecommunication data systems infrastructure company. In anticipation of the explosive growth of mobile data services, he set out on his own in 2004. Since then he's launched and consulted on numerous mobile content services, and even founded a mobile application development company. He is tasked with translating the great ideas and developments of the uxebu team.
