JavaScript Developer
--------------------

[James Padolsey](../media/img/team/padolsey.jpg)

I'm fanatic about JavaScript, especially expressive APIs, HTML5 Canvas, and more recently: node.js. My first exposure to code was in crude combinations of PHP and XHTML. I slowly mustered the courage to learn JavaScript, and eventually picked up jQuery. Not soon after that I fell back into the then-lonely caverns of unabstracted JavaScript and DOM spaghetti, from where I slowly, piece by piece, learned the language and APIs properly and finally understood their true value.

I now promote JS wherever possible and enjoy having pointless debates over its idiosyncrasies while developing awesome things.
